                <p class="text">I am a dynamic and self-motivated Computer Science Student at UW Bothell. I am always
                    finding learning opportunities to grow personally and professionally.
                    I have solid experience in project management, public relations, implementation of business models,
                    and implementations of SDLCs.
                    I started my journey interning with iUrban Teen as their data engineer. I audited the PNW region's
                    employee time sheets and processed event survey data to harvest demographic statistics
                    for the purpose of grant writing. I finished this internship having constructed a data processing
                    algorithm to organize past event statistics in order to provide upper management with
                    information necessary to write grant applications and impact reports. This program has been able to
                    conduct the work that was asked of me during my time at iUrban Teen.
                    Flexible and timely towards multi tasked roles. Excellent in time management and enjoys problem
                    solving.
                    Loves innovation and challenging opportunities.
